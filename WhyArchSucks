That's an unprotected page on the wiki, not an authoritative source on
anything to do with the distribution.

Arch has always been a simple distribution in terms of the developer
perspective, not the user one. Using systemd made it simpler than ever
in that regard because much more work is taken care of by both the
systemd developers and all of the projects shipping unit files.

It has never been a minimalist distribution. Splitting packages is rare
compared to other distributions, and dependencies aren't made optional
whenever possible.

It has also never been a distribution offering much user freedom /
choice compared to Gentoo and even Debian. There are very few cases
where there are multiple packages offering different configurations of
the same project. There's no equivalent to update-alternatives or the
comparable uses of USE flags. Changing /bin/sh from Bash will be broken,
as will changing the python symlink to point to python2 instead of
python3 even though this works on some other distributions. It doesn't
strive to offer choices like this, and never has. It would mean a *lot*
more complexity on the development side of things along with major
deviations from upstream.

Arch is the *opposite* of a user-centric freedom. The opinion of users
has no weight here. Only the developers have an opinion, and there
aren't voting systems as there are in Debian. Technical decisions are
made based on merit via consensus among the developers, not popularity.


> it is not simple, not minimalist, and not user-centric.

Certainly not minimalist, but those other two claims are questionable.

Arch has *never* been minimalist... a Linux kernel with every module
available and every feature enabled at least when there's no non-bloat
related cost, feature-packed/complex GNU tools, nearly all optional
features enabled across all the packages, etc.

Arch is the opposite of a distribution with lots of user freedom. Users
will come and go based on whether they like the technical decisions made
by the developers. The popularily of those decisions has no impact on
how things are done, regardless of how vocal users are about it.

You can still use it, it's just becoming increasing more difficult at a
pretty steady pace. Those packages didn't suddenly pick up systemd
dependencies in the past few weeks / months anyway. The version control
logs disprove the claim that there are many recent changes.

Gentoo has USE flags so features can be optional at compile-time. Many
of the packages with dependencies on systemd in Arch link against
libsystemd, and we don't split up the package as is the norm here. If
there's a package with an *unnecessary* dependency on systemd, you can
and should file a bug. I don't think there are many that depend on it
and don't use it.

What hypocrisy? When have you seen the developers state that they care
about user freedom, or that the distribution is based on minimalism?

Community memes don't define the distribution, technical choices by the
developers do. It's clearly not based on what you say it is, and *never*
has been. It has always used significantly more disk space and a
measurable amount of additional memory than Debian and especially Gentoo
as a consequence of keeping things simple (again, from a development
perspective).

That's what you're doing.

You can claim that the community is based on a set of principles, but it
has nothing to do with technical decisions by the developers. Memes
about minimalism and user freedom != actual distribution policy /
principles / history.
